Flyy is an open-source obstacle avoidance game created in Unity3D. It was originally made in a week and was published to both Kongregate.com and the Android Marketplace. I decided to open-source the code to showcase my work and allow beginner Unity3D users the option to play around with a simple game that has already been built.
